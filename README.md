# React Canvas Text Editor

This project is a dynamic **Text Editor** built using **React.js** and the HTML5 `<canvas>` element. It allows users to add, move, and edit text on a canvas. Additionally, it offers features like undo/redo, font size control, text styling (bold, italic, underline), and changing the font family through an intuitive UI.

## Features

- **Add Text**: Add new text to the canvas at a default position.
- **Move Text**: Click and drag text objects to move them around the canvas.
- **Edit Text**: Double-click any text on the canvas to edit the content.
- **Undo/Redo**: Undo or redo the last text modifications or movements.
- **Text Formatting**: 
  - Adjust the font size of the selected text.
  - Change font family through a dropdown.
  - Toggle text styles: Bold, Italic, Underline.
- **Color Picker**: Change the text color using an integrated color picker.
- **Cursor Change**: The cursor changes to a pointer when hovering over a selectable text.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Handles the UI and application state.
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Enables drawing and manipulating text directly on a graphical interface.
- **CSS**: Provides the design for the toolbar, buttons, and layout.

## How to Use

1. **Add Text**: Click the "Add Text" button to activate a text input field. You can enter text and move it within the canvas.
2. **Move Text**: Click on any text and drag it to a new position within the canvas.
3. **Edit Text**: Double-click on text to open the text input for editing.
4. **Change Font & Style**: Use the controls at the bottom of the canvas to modify the font size, family, and style.
5. **Undo/Redo**: Use the Undo/Redo buttons at the top of the canvas to reverse your actions.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-canvas-text-editor.git
